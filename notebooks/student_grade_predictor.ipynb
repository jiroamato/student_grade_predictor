    "The data set used in this project is the Student Performance dataset created by Paulo Cortez from the University of Minho, Portugal (Cortez and Silva 2008). It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Cortez 2014) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance). The dataset contains information on 649 students from two Portuguese secondary schools, with data collected through school reports and questionnaires. Each row represents a student with 30 features including demographic information (age, sex, family size), educational background (parental education, past failures, study time), social factors (going out, romantic relationships, alcohol consumption), and school-related features (absences, extra support, desire for higher education). The dataset also includes grades from the first period (G1), second period (G2), and final grade (G3), with G3 serving as the target variable for prediction.\n"

    "Linear regression was used to build a predictive model to estimate students' final grades (G3). All variables included in the original data set were used to fit the model. Data was split with 75% being partitioned into the training set and 25% being partitioned into the test set. Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and $R^2$ score were used to evaluate model performance on the test set. All numerical variables were standardized and categorical variables were one-hot encoded just prior to model fitting."
