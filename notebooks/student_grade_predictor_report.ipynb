    "We built a linear regression model utilizing Ridge Regression, which leverages student demographic data, behavioral insights, and previous assessment scores to forecast a student's final grade (G3) in a Portuguese language course. Our final model showed strong performance on the unseen test data, achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.86 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.78. For the test data predictions, the model deviated from the actual grades by an average of less than one grade point, indicating a high level of accuracy. Although the model demonstrated great reliability in predicting grades within the passing range (scores exceeding 8), residual analysis indicated that it was less precise for students with lower scores or those receiving a zero, frequently overestimating their performance. With this limitation concerning failing students, we conclude that this model showcases adequate performance to serve as a decision-support tool for educators for which to project final grades midway through the term.\n",

    "Student academic success is influenced by a complex combination of personal, social, and educational factors. Understanding the determinants of performance and being able to reliably predict student outcomes has important implications for supporting learning, designing interventions, and improving educational strategies. Despite decades of pedagogical research, identifying at-risk students early remains challenging because performance is shaped by many interacting variables such as family background, study habits, school engagement, and socio-economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we ask whether a machine learning algorithm can be used to predict a student’s final grade based on their demographic attributes, family characteristics, school-related behaviours, and past academic performance. Answering this question is valuable because traditional methods of assessing student progress often rely on subjective teacher evaluations or mid-course assessments, which may miss early warning signs or overlook external factors influencing learning. If a machine learning model can accurately and consistently predict final grades, this could help educators identify students in need of additional support earlier, design more targeted interventions, and ultimately contribute to improved educational outcomes."

    "The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance dataset created by Paulo Cortez from the University of Minho, Portugal (Cortez and Silva 2008). It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Cortez 2014) and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance). The dataset contains information on 649 students from two Portuguese secondary schools, with data collected through school reports and questionnaires. Each row represents a student with 30 features including demographic information (age, sex, family size), educational background (parental education, past failures, study time), social factors (going out, romantic relationships, alcohol consumption), and school-related features (absences, extra support, desire for higher education). The dataset also includes grades from the first period (G1), second period (G2), and final grade (G3), with G3 serving as the target variable for prediction.\n"

    "We used a linear regression model with Ridge regularization to predict the final grade target variable (G3). The model utilized all available features from the dataset, including student demographics, family background, and prior assessment scores (G1 and G2). We split the data into a 70% training set and a 30% test set prior to fitting. To optimize performance, we tuned the regularization hyperparameter alpha using 10-fold cross-validation and Randomized Search, selecting Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric to prioritize interpretability and robustness against outliers. Preprocessing involved standardizing numeric features—applying Robust Scaler specifically to skewed distributions like absences—and transforming categorical variables via One-Hot Encoding. The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) and its data science ecosystem, including Pandas (McKinney 2010), Altair (VanderPlas 2018), and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011).

The model's performance in predicting students with lower grade outcomes is less reliable and should be met with caution. A more useful but harder to achieve model would be one without `G1` and `G2` features which would be worthwhile to explore."
